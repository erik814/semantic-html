## Tasks

While working on this, I went through the HTML code and tried to make it more specific. I started by replacing div elements that were obvious to me. Nav, section, footer. Once I was done with that, I still had a handful of div elements left that I wasn't totally sure about. I reviewed my notes and did a little googling. From there I was able to add figure, aside, and article.

When I made the change to a nav element, the navigation bar on the webpage got a little out of place. From there I had to go through the CSS portion of the code to figure out what was going on and correct it.

## What I Learned

While working on this assignment I learned the importance of semantic elements. As I replaced div elements with semantic elements, I found that the code became easier for me to read and navigate. I also learned how important it is to make sure that your classes match up between HTML and CSS. If I make a change on one, I need to make sure the other language is changed to reflect that.
